# PHP Project Starter with HTMX

This is a simple web app using PHP as the back-end.

## Features

- HTTP request types: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

- File/folder-based pages (i.e. no routing)

- Basic templating for page layouts via HTML partials

- Support for [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) components

## Code

There are two versions of the system here:

- The **dist** folder contains a minimal system for starting a new project.

- The **demo** folder contains the routing system with some demo pages and templates.
